# Sensor_data_sim

A simple implementation of a buffer using  a dynamic array to simulate senor reading and process and display them
This Program was written in respose to an intervew assignment given by Nosh Robotics
The following Question was asked

Q C program in an online compiler,
1. Use timer to simulate data generated by external sensor. Setup the timer to trigger every
second and generates random number (0 to 5) of random bytes and adds this to a globally
accessible data structure.
2. Separately wake up periodically (every 10s), checks if 50 bytes are stored in the globally
accessible data structure and prints only the latest 50 bytes (in hex value) and deletes the
printed bytes from the data structure.
3. For example, 1st second 4 bytes are added, 2nd second 3 bytes are added and 10th
second there are 39 bytes are in the buffer. Thus at 10th second data is not printed. At 20th
second, if there are more than 50 bytes in the buffer, the main thread only prints the latest
50 bytes and deletes them.

Considerations:
â€¢ Make an application that can be run on online c compiler platforms like
https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/.


Based on the question we need the program maintains a buffer that can grow as needed and handles 
the "latest 50 bytes" requirement correctly.

The best data structure to implemet this is an arraylist
Since the requirement was for a globally accessible buffer the arraylist funtions implemented have 
no reference parametes to make the code cleaner.

We use the srand() and rand() functions to initialize and generate the random values every one second

Example Output
When 50 bytes are collected:

A3, 17, F2, 8D, 3E, 9C, 45, 22, BB, 01,
6F, C4, 7A, 33, 91, 58, D0, 0F, 67, AE,
29, 84, 12, 5B, C3, 76, EF, 47, 9A, 52,
B8, 2F, 81, 19, D4, 63, A5, 0C, 7B, E2,
3D, 95, 4E, 27, 8F, 11, 69, D2, 40, B7,
removing 50 bytes from buffer

Extra features:
-Debug mode for monitoring data generation
-The counter will reset after reaching UINT_MAX-2 to prevent overflow
